### Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

### Prerequisites

Familiarity with analysis in several variables, complex analysis, linear algebra and basic functional analysis, basic differential geometry. For some parts: Riemann surfaces, fundamentals of Lie groups. Knowledge of advanced physics is not required.

### Description

The development of quantum field theory and string theory in the last four decades led to an unprecedented level of interaction between physics and mathematics, incorporating into physics such "pure" areas of mathematics as algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, representation theory, combinatorics, and even number theory. This interaction has been highly fruitful in both directions, and led to a necessity for physicists to know basic mathematics and for mathematicians to know basic physics. Physicists have been quick to learn, and nowadays good physicists know relevant areas of mathematics as deeply as professional mathematicians. On the other hand, many mathematicians have been slower, intimidated by the absence of rigor in physical texts, and, more importantly, by a different manner of presentation. In particular, even the basic setting of quantum field theory, necessary for understanding its more advanced (and mathematically exciting) parts, is already largely unfamiliar to mathematicians. Nevertheless, many of the basic ideas of quantum field theory can in fact be presented in a completely rigorous and mathematical way. Doing so will be the main goal of this course.         

*Note: This is a course primarily for mathematicians. Physicists will not learn much in it, except how to present the ideas of QFT (which they already know) in a mathematical way. It is important to note that the instructor knows less QFT than a graduate student specializing in QFT or string theory.*  
 

## Topics

1. 0-dimensional QFT: Stationary phase (steepest descent) formula. Calculus of Feynman diagrams with applications to combinatorics. Matrix models, large N limits. 
2. 1-dimensional QFT: Formalism of classical mechanics. Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, least action principle. Path integral approach to quantum mechanics. Perturbative expansion using Feynman diagrams. Operator formalism. Feynman-Kac formula.
3. d-dimensional QFT for d > 1: Formalism of classical  field theory. Gauge theories. Currents, charges, Noether's theorem. Path integral approach to QFT. Free  eld theories. Perturbative expansion. Divergences. Renormalization theory.
4. Supergeometry and supersymmetry.
5. Introduction to 2-dimensional conformal  eld theory. The Kontsevich-Segal axioms. The Wess-Zumino-Witten model attached to a compact simple Lie group. Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and computation of the correlation functions.      

### Textbooks and Notes

A recommended textbook for the course is Quantum Fields and Strings: A Course for Mathematicians, AMS, 1998 (but I won't closely follow it). Instead, I will have typed notes and initially follow the notes given here {{% resource_link "52ba79d3-83b7-4a27-8dc0-b50442d9d01a" "Geometry and Quantum Field Theory" %}}   

### Assignments

#### Weekly Homework

The written homework is extremely important (mathematics is not a spectator sport). The best way to test your knowledge of a concept is to try and use it; this is why you work problems. Collaboration with other students in the class is encouraged, but separate solutions must be written up and collaborators documented at the top right-hand corner of all submitted work. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, circumstances may arise that warrant an extension; such an extension request should be emailed to the instructor. The lowest individual homework grade will be dropped when computing the final homework grade for the course.

### Grading

The course grade is based on weekly homework, which is required for those taking the course for credit.
